jQuery is a lightweight Javascript library which is blazing fast and concise. 
This library was created by John Resig in 2006 and

jQuery has been designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, 
as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.

jQuery can be used to find a particular HTML element in the HTML document with a certain ID,
class or attribute and later we can use jQuery to change one or more of attributes of the same element like color,
visibility etc. jQuery can also be used to make a webpage interactive by responding to an event like a mouse click.
